Changes, most recent at the top

Reworked to function on newer versions of Node. The original was stuck at
v0.10, due to changes in v0.12. This update brings support up to v10, but
not v12 or later.

This update based on the following fork:
  https://github.com/nextorigin/node-kstat
with my changes to add JKstat support.
