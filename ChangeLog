Reworked again to add support for Node v12. There are a lot of deprecation
warnings (it doesn't understand Maybe), but this version will also work
on Node v10; it won't work on Node v14 or later.

Reworked to function on newer versions of Node. The original was stuck at
v0.10, due to changes in v0.12. This update brings support up to v10, but
not v12 or later.

This update based on the following fork:
  https://github.com/nextorigin/node-kstat
with my changes to add JKstat support.
